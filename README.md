# TURNING-ON-AC-MOTOR-USING-PUSH-BUTTON
# ABSTRACT 
This project called ”TURNING ON AC MOTOR USING PUSH BUTTON” the basic control of the motor for this project will be based on “ ARDUINO UNO “ circuit , to turn on an ac motor by pressing a push button to transmit  the signal to  arduino Uno to switch the coil of relay that will control an Ac motor to be turned on.  This motor will be used in some electrical equipment and machine to convert the electrical energy into mechanical energy for the main application in various equipment such as: irrigation pumps, water heaters, lawn and garden equipment, ovens, and off-road motorized equipment.  However the controlling of an Ac motor were exist by using the push button and a contractor, for this reason we applied the recent development to
